# ðŸ“Š Project: Complex API 2

### Goal: Use data returned from one api to make a request to another api and display the data returned

I completed the challenge: 4

I feel good about my code: 4

Orginally had issues getting both API's to work. Planning to add an input to search for characters, currently is only randomized. WIll also uodate with CSS.
